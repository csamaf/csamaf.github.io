# Adding a new author

I just added a new author to the site. [This is how I did it]
(https://github.com/csamaf/csamaf.github.io/pull/9/commits/26a62ee99ff5afea1bdb762106b22f81b76af5d3)

So the steps are:

1. Add a new markdown file to the `about` directory. And potentially an image.
2. Add the new author to the `conf.py` file.
3. Add a new ignore pattern in the markdown link checker config.
4. Update `.mailmap`
